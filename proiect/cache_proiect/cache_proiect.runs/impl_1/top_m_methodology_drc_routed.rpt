There is a large setup violation of -2.157 ns between DUT/u_Arbiter/o_grant_id_reg[1]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and DUT/gen_cores[0].u_Cache/r_cache_lines_reg[2][32]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
